# Unifier
**An addon to improve the workflow in Blender 2.80 and fix the multi-engine issue.**

I've been quite irritated with the UI mess that is Blender 2.8. You normally need to move between engines to change most options. This addon aims to "Unify" the engines into one large engine (Cycles) and allow you to do things like edit materials from the matcap engine or from the solid engine. You can also change the post processing effects for the real-time engine from the toolbar as well.

There is also some discussion about this on [Unifier's Blender Developer page](https://developer.blender.org/T55120).
